# Project-ARIS
Project ARIS is a proof-of-concept discovery engine for the solo researcher. It demonstrates how local LLMs (Ollama) can be used to scan MAST data for physics-breaking anomalies. Features a cinematic Mission Control interface, 3D visualization, and a "Neural Link" terminal. A vision for AI-assisted hunting.
